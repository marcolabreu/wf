Algorithm:

	1. Get first part of the string using floor
	2. Get last part of the string using ceil
	3. Concatenate the firstpart, the salt and the second part

The test will provide a value for $salt
The test will provide a value for $password
The test will use $saltedPassword as output

Tips: Take care if the password length is odd or even
